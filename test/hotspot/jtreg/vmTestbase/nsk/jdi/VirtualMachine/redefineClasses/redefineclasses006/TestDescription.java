 * @test
 *
 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/VirtualMachine/redefineClasses/redefineclasses006.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi, redefine]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test against the method com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachine.redefineClasses()
 *     and checks up the following assertion:
 *        "If canUnrestrictedlyRedefineClasses() is false, attempting to
 *         delete a method will throw UnsupportedOperationException exception"
 *     The test consists of the following files:
 *         redefineclasses006.java             - debugger
 *         redefineclasses006a.java            - initial debuggee
 *         newclassXX/redefineclasses006a.java - redefining debuggees
 *     This test performs the following cases:
 *       1. newclass01 - deleting a public method
 *       2. newclass02 - deleting a protected method
 *       3. newclass03 - deleting a private method
 *       4. newclass04 - deleting a private package method
 *     The test checks two different cases for suspended debugee and not
 *     suspended one.
 * COMMENTS:
 *     Test was fixed according to test bug:
 *     4778296 TEST_BUG: debuggee VM intemittently hangs after resuming
 *     - handling VMStartEvent was removed from the debugger part of the test
